Suraj Kumar<br/>
Delhi-based MERN Stack Developer | 4+ Years of Experience

I'm Suraj Kumar, a passionate and results-driven MERN Stack Developer based in Delhi with over 4 years of hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and RESTful APIs. I specialize in full-stack development using Node.js, React.js, MongoDB, and Express, and have also worked extensively with modern tools and frameworks like Next.js, NestJS, Prisma, and SQL databases.

I hold a Bachelor of Vocation (B.Voc) in Software Development from IP University, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and software engineering principles.

Throughout my career, I’ve contributed to various projects across different domains, consistently delivering clean, efficient, and maintainable code. My core strength lies in understanding complex business requirements and transforming them into high-performing digital solutions.

I’m always open to new challenges, collaborative projects, and opportunities that push my technical boundaries.
